## Release Cycle {#release-cycle}

AT4J does not have a fixed release cycle.

- Patch releases are released as needed.

- Minor releases always contain new features, with a typical time frame of 3~6 months in between. Minor releases always go through a beta pre-release phase.

- Major releases will be announced ahead of time, and will go through an early discussion phase and alpha / beta pre-release phases.

## Semantic Versioning-Edge Cases {#semantic-versioning-edge-cases}

AT4J releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with a few edge cases.

## Deprecations {#deprecations}

We may periodically deprecate features that have new, better replacements in minor releases. Deprecated features will continue to work, and will be removed in the next major release after it entered deprecated status.
